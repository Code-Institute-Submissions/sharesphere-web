## UI/UX

- UI

  - The overall look and design of ShareSphere aim to create a calm and visually pleasing experience. This is achieved by utilizing a clean, modern design with an intuitive layout that is easy on the eyes.

  - The dark theme and carefully selected color palette enhance readability and reduce eye strain, while maintaining a stylish and contemporary feel.

  - Layout, responsiveness, and navigation follow familiar patterns to ensure users can effortlessly navigate the site without confusion, providing a seamless and intuitive experience.

- UX

  - Interactivity is a core focus of ShareSphere, promoting rich user-to-user engagement through features such as likes, comments, and follows.

  - The design ensures a fluid experience when interacting with posts and comments. By utilizing react and react states any operation performed can be instantly reflected to the user, like editing or deleting a comment updating the list of comments already rendered.

  - ShareSphere provides a responsive and adaptive user interface that works seamlessly across all devices, ensuring that users have a consistent experience whether they are on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.

  - Navigating different types of content is intuitive and easy. The user may simply infinitely scroll until there is no more content to display. This goes for posts, comments, conversations, and conversation replies.

### Agile

The entirety of this project has been built utilizing the agile development approach. The agile approach, combined with GitHub projects, has served as a tool that has helped visualize, plan, and execute different phases of the project development. The [GitHub project](https://github.com/users/Felteng/projects/4) created for this project features a kanban board where the various issues and their status can be seen. This backend application's repository as well as the backend API repository share the same project board to ensure a seamless integration of development between the two.

To view the user stories set out for this project please refer to the project link in the above paragraph. By clicking on any user story on the board a detailed view containing the user story and its acceptance criteria will be made visible. All the issues on the kanban board have received different labels to convey things like relevancy and importance. Frontend and backend related issues have their own separate labels and issues may be filtered as such.

### Wireframes

The initial Balsamiq wireframes are very simplified mockups of site layout to help steer development and design.

### Visual Design Ideology

**Color Scheme:**

- The base scheme of the site is built with "dark theme" in mind as it's a theme becoming increasingly popular and tends to be a lot easier on the eyes for the user. There is not sacrifice in contrast or user experience to achieve the darker aestetic. The goal is to provide a friendly looking interface that won't appall the user from using the site for any extended periods of time.

- To achieve the darker theme every page features shade of woodsmoke as the background. \
  ![Background color](readme-assets/background-hex.png)

- The navbar aims to contrast the woodsmoke background with a more shark-like color and stand out a bit more as a call to action for navigation. The color for the nav links is more grey shade of white to ensure the visibility is in line with the WCAG standards. \
  ![Navbar color](readme-assets/navbar-hex.png) \
  ![Navbar text color](readme-assets/navbar-text-hex.png)

- The follow button to follow a user features a fiord blue color which provides a clear call to action when paired with the dark woodsmoke color whilst still fitting the calm overview of colors. \
  ![Follow button color](readme-assets/follow-button-hex.png)

- All the main content text elements feature an ever so slightly off-shade of white which simply provides a good contrast against the dark background \
  ![Content text color](readme-assets/text-hex.png)

**Fonts:**

- Montserrat

  - The Montserrat font has been used in the navbar elements as well as the heading for most active posters. It's featured across various smaller elements like the profile name and join date. This font is chosen for its clean, modern appearance and excellent readability, which ensures that essential navigational and informational elements stand out clearly to users. Its geometric style conveys a professional feel, enhancing the overall user experience by making text easy to scan and aesthetically pleasing.

- Open Sans

  - The Open Sans font is used across most other elements and user-created content, with different font weights to convey the difference, for example, in a title. This font is chosen for its versatility and readability, making it ideal for body text and longer passages. Its clean and friendly appearance ensures that user-generated content is easy to read and engage with, while the variety of font weights allows for clear distinctions, enhancing the overall visual structure and user experience of the application.

- sans-serif
  - sans-serif is utlized as the fallback font in the event that the google fonts import would seize to function.

**Images:**

- Standardized imagery does not see a whole lot of use throughout this project, the focus lies heavily in user-posted imagery.

  - 2 simple default images are used for new users, and the other one for posts that have not had a custom image added to them.

  - A standard image upload icon is present for the post creation form.

  - Lastly there are 2 different illustrations of a sphere used as a feature image for the sign up and sign in pages respectively. They are present on tablet sizes and larger with the purpose of simply filling out some of the space on the pages.

**Icons:**

- Icons are featured and serve great purpose with intents to convey action without the need for long descriptions or buttons with text. The icon usage ranges from everything from a heart icon for liking posts to a right from bracket for logging out for larger screen navbars.

  - Icons can be found, but not limited to, profile pages where they convey message creation and enforce the name and join data info, on conversations where they convey reply count, and on posts where they convey like and comment count. \

    ![Like icon](readme-assets/like-icon.png)
    ![Sign out icon](readme-assets/logout-icon.png)
    ![Post comment icon](readme-assets/post-comment-icon.png)
    ![Edit comment icon](readme-assets/edit-comment-icon.png)
    ![Edit profile icon](readme-assets/edit-profile-icon.png) \
    A few examples of icons that may be found on the website.

  - By default the name and bio fields are empty, and they are optional.

  - The image field is populated with the default image for new users.

  - Receive messages is toggeld on by default and may be toggled off if the user wishes to not have conversations started with them.

  - Attempting to upload an avatar that is too large will display an error.

  - Successfully updating the profile will update the avatar in the navbar and redirect the user back to their profile with the updated content.

### Future Features



### CRUD Features

The principles of CRUD are at the essence of this project's features and any future features. The database modal and these CRUD features are also mentioned in the [readme for the API](https://github.com/Felteng/sharesphere-api/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#database-design).

**Create:**
An authenticated user can create posts, like posts, follow other users, create post comments, and send direct messages to other users that have receive messages enabled.

**Read:**
A user can browse and read any posts made on the website and see their respective amount of comments and likes, posts can also be sorted by ones the user has liked or from users they follow. Comments made under any post can be read by any user. If the user is engaged in any conversation with another user the contents of that conversation may also be read at any time. The amount of followers and or the amount of users a user follows can be seen from each indiviual users profile page.

**Update:**
An authenticated user can edit and update their profile as well as their individual contributuions to the site, bar conversations and their replies.

- The reason a conversation or reply cannot be edited is to avoid any malicious altering of a private conversation between 2 indivuals to make it seem as though a user had different intents in relation previous messages. They may still be deleted to ensure controlled privacy.
  - This could be worked around as a future feature where any updates made would save history of the previous versions of an object.

**Delete:**
An authenticated user can delete any of their contributions made to the site. Unfollowing, unliking, removing a post and all its comments, removing an individual comment, removing a conversation and all its replies, removing an individual reply..



### Addressed bugs

- Refreshing the page gives a brief flash of a view as though the user isn't authenticated.

  - This leads to more than just an odd visual. It can also generate faulty API requests where the logged in users id is used, but before the AuthContext useEffect hook has set the loggedInUser state the loggedInUser.pk will = undefined.

    - So instead of making a get request to "/posts/?likes**owner**profile=1" we end up making a get request to "/posts/?likes**owner**profile=undefined" until the loggedInUser state has been set.

  - The solution to this is to store the user data in a loggedInUser local storage object and use that object as the defualt value for the loggedInUser state:
    ```js
    const [loggedInUser, setLoggedInUser] = useState(() => {
      const savedLogin = localStorage.getItem("loggedInUser");
      return savedLogin ? JSON.parse(savedUser) : null;
    });
    ```
  - The logic used for managing the loggedInUser object:

    ```js
    useEffect(() => {
      const verifyLogin = async () => {
        const data = await checkLoginStatus();
        const savedLogin = localStorage.getItem("loggedInUser");

        if (!savedLogin && data) {
          setLoggedInUser(data);
          localStorage.setItem("loggedInUser", JSON.stringify(data));
        } else if (savedLogin && !data) {
          setLoggedInUser(null);
          localStorage.removeItem("loggedInUser");
        } else if (savedLogin && data && savedLogin !== data) {
          setLoggedInUser(data);
          localStorage.setItem("loggedInUser", JSON.stringify(data));
        }
      };
      verifyLogin();
    }, []);
    ```

  - A request will still be made on mount to ensure that the user should still have access and if they don't then the localStorage object is managed accordingly.

- Repeatedly clicking the like button on a post leads to faulty duplicate requests and error spam in console.

  ![Console logs after spamming the like button](readme-assets/like-spam.png)

  - This is because clicking the button will keep triggering the function that handles the API request even if a request is alreadt being made.

  - The solution to the problem is simply to disable the functions from trying API requests if one is in progress.

    - This was done by adding a new useState hook and and using it's condition for the like and unlike functions:

    ```js
      * const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false); *

      const handleLike = async () => {
        * if (loading) return; *
        * setLoading(true); *
        try {
          const { data } = await axiosRes.post("/likes/", { post: id });
          setLikeCount(likeCount + 1);
          setLike(data.id);
        } catch (error) {
          console.log("Error when liking", error);
        } finally {
          * setLoading(false); *
        }
      };

      const handleUnlike = async () => {
        * if (loading) return; *
        * setLoading(true); *
        try {
          await axiosRes.delete(`likes/${like}`);
          setLikeCount(likeCount - 1);
          setLike(null);
        } catch (error) {
          console.log("Error when unliking", error);
        } finally {
          * setLoading(false); *
        }
      };
    ```

### Unaddressed bugs

- Whenever a comment, a post, or a reply that is part of a page that has a next value is deleted the amount of objects deleted will be missed when fetching the next page.

  - For example a post with 17 comments would have 2 comments on the next page for infinite scroll to fetch when needed, but if I delete 2 of my comments from the first page of 15 comments those 2 comments on the next page will have moved to the first page on the backend, but when infiniteScroll tries to fetch the next page they will not be there and will therefore not be rendered.

    - I haven't landed on a specfic solution for it that would keep the neat responsive flow of react rendering.

      - A possible fix would be to fetch the first object on the next page before performing the deletion.

- Similar to the bug above when adding a comment or reply, the older objects on the current page will get pushed to the next page, and when the next page is fetched they will be added again as duplicates.
